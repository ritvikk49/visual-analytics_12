<div style="text-align: justify;">We have created visualisations on the data based off of questions that were curated from the dataset to understand it better. These visualisation give us an answer in the best possible way.

The visualisations are on an introductory level of what can be further expanded to help firms and individuals understand the data and derive desired conclusions from it. Looking at the raw dataset cannot provide much understanding usless it is processed to a more visually appealing and easily understandable way. We have attempted to achieve this by making this application.</div>
